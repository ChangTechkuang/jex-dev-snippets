# 📦 JEX Dev Snippets (v3.0)

A personal basecode library for reusable, efficient development using the **JEX framework (v3.0)** — including Java `action` classes, XML `ido` queries, HTML views, and JavaScript helpers.

This repo is designed to work smoothly with **Cursor AI** or **ChatGPT** to accelerate coding through prompt-based or searchable reuse of known logic.

## 🧠 How to Use This Basecode with AI

Use AI (Cursor or ChatGPT) to:
- Search with: "Do I have a JS method to debounce input?"
- Prompt with: "Use my basecode’s HTML form template"
- Auto-save generated snippets to the right folder with proper tags

You can use this library with **Cursor AI**, ChatGPT, or other LLMs.  
Here’s how to prompt effectively:

### 🔍 Search Prompt Example

> “Do I already have a utility to debounce input in JavaScript?”

> “Check if I have a template for form submission view in HTML.”

### ⚡ Code Injection Prompt

> “Use my existing `utils/debounce_input.js` to delay search input.”

> “Insert the `user_form.html` template from the basecode.”
